Wordle is a word puzzle game where players have six attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word. Each guess provides feedback on which letters are correctly placed, present but in the wrong position, or not in the word at all. This repository contains a console-based implementation of the Wordle game in Python.

Features
Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects a five-letter word from a predefined list.
User Input: Players input their guesses, which are validated for length and content.
Feedback System: Provides feedback on each guess with information about correct and incorrect letters.
Game Management: Allows players up to six attempts to guess the word correctly, with appropriate messages for win or loss conditions.
